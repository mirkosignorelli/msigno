# Simple and minimalist package with some useful functions
This (simple and VERY minimalist) R package  contains a bunch of functions for data management and visualization that I find useful in my daily use of R. 
A couple of these functions (pmf, make.spaghetti) are directly borrowed from my [ptmixed package](https://github.com/m-signo/ptmixed) that can be downloaded from CRAN.
Note that this package is not meant to be a public package (I upload it to a public repository just so that my collaborators may use it when needed), and it comes without any guarantee on its content.

Here's how you can install it from the R console:

> install.packages("https://github.com/m-signo/functions/raw/master/msigno_0.5.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

Alternatively, you can download the tarball and install it manually.
